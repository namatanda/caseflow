# Implementation Plan: Backend Development

## Phase 1: Backend API Foundation

**Note**: Tasks 5.1 and 5.2 must be completed before any endpoint implementation tasks (7-11) can begin, as they provide the required repositories and services.

- [x] 1. Create new branch for frontend-backend decoupling migration
  - Create and checkout
  - Ensure branch is based on latest main/master branch
  - Push initial branch to remote repository for collaboration
  - Set up branch protection rules if needed for code review process
  - _Requirements: 12.4 (rollback procedures)_

- [x] 2. Set up Express.js backend application structure
  - Create new `backend/` directory with proper folder structure
  - Initialize package.json with required dependencies (express, cors, helmet, etc.)
  - Set up TypeScript configuration and build scripts
  - Create basic Express app with middleware setup
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 7.1_

- [x] 3. Implement core middleware and security
  - Create authentication middleware with JWT token validation
  - Implement CORS middleware with configurable origins
  - Add rate limiting middleware for API protection
  - Create request logging middleware with correlation IDs
  - Implement global error handling middleware
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 7.8_

- [x] 4. Set up database and Redis connections
  - Configure Prisma client for backend service
  - Create database connection utilities with health checks
  - Set up Redis connection for caching and sessions
  - Implement connection pooling and error handling
  - Create database migration scripts for backend
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.6, 6.5_

- [x] 5. Create base repository and service patterns
  - Implement base repository class with common CRUD operations
  - Create service layer interfaces and base classes
  - Set up dependency injection container for services
  - Implement transaction handling utilities
  - Create data validation utilities using Zod schemas
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 8.8_

- [x] 5.1 Implement all domain repositories
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 5.2 Implement all domain services
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 8.8_

## Phase 2: Authentication and Authorization System

- [x] 6. Implement JWT authentication system
  - Create JWT token generation and validation utilities
  - Implement login endpoint with email/password validation
  - Create refresh token mechanism with secure storage
  - Implement logout endpoint with token invalidation
  - Add password hashing and verification utilities
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Create user management endpoints
  - Implement GET /api/v1/auth/me endpoint for user profile using UserService
  - Create user role-based authorization middleware
  - Implement user session management with Redis
  - Add user activity logging for security auditing
  - Create password reset functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 5.5, 11.5_
